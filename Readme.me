Here I have used single GET resource method to get the product information for Home Page screen.
Using Query Parameter type("FEATURED", "RATED) we can get the results based on type.
In products table, we have category column, so based on type we can fetch result where it contains category for each result("POWER_TOOLS", "HAND_TOOLS", "PLUMBING") .etc...
